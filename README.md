# Accident-Severity-Prediction
# 🚗 Accident Severity Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to predict the **severity of road accidents** using **machine learning models**.  
By analyzing real-world accident data, it identifies critical factors such as weather, road conditions, vehicle type, and driver behavior that contribute to accident severity.  
The insights help improve **road safety policies** and assist authorities in **emergency response planning**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Accident Severity Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Size:** ~100,000+ records with multiple features  
- **Features:** Weather, road surface, lighting, vehicle type, driver age, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** Accident Severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)

---

## 🔍 Process
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and categorical inconsistencies  
2. **EDA:** Explored correlations between weather, vehicle, and road conditions  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical variables, normalized data  
4. **Model Training:** Trained and compared models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM  
5. **Evaluation:** Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance measurement

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** ~88%  
- **Key Predictors:** Weather condition, road surface, and time of day  
- **Outcome:** Reliable prediction of accident severity with actionable insights
